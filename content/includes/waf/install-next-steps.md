Once you have successfully installed F5 WAF for NGINX, there are some topics you may want to follow afterwards:

- [Configure policies]({{< ref "/waf/policies/configuration.md" >}}), to begin customizing your deployment
- [Secure traffic using mTLS]({{< ref "/waf/configure/secure-mtls.md" >}}), for an extra layer of security between NGINX and F5 WAF enforcer
- [IP intelligence]({{< ref "/waf/policies/ip-intelligence.md">}}), to enable the IP intelligence feature
- [Converter tools]({{< ref "/waf/tools/converters.md" >}}), to convert existing resources from a BIG-IP environment
- [Changelog]({{< ref "/waf/changelog.md" >}}), to view information from the latest releases
