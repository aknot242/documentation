{{< call-out "warning" "Information architecture note" >}}

The term _disconnected environment_ has become the more commmon synonym for an air-gapped or offline installation. It follows the precedent set by NGINX Instance Manager: [Deploy in a disconnected environment -> Install the latest NGINX Instance Manager with a script (disconnected)]({{< ref "/nim/disconnected/offline-install-guide.md" >}}).

The design intention for this page is as a standalone page for the operating system specific installation use cases:

- [v4]({{< ref "/nap-waf/v4/admin-guide/install.md#offline-installation" >}})
- [v5]({{< ref "/nap-waf/v5/admin-guide/install.md#air-gap-install-secure-offline-installation" >}})

Instead of having separate top level folders, differences between v4 and v5 will be denoted with whole page sections, tabs, or other unique signifiers.
